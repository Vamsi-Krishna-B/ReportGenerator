## 📄 ReportGenerator – Multi-Agent AI Report Generation System

ReportGenerator is an intelligent, multi-agent report generation application built using LangGraph and FastAPI.
It uses a coordinated network of AI agents—each responsible for tasks such as topic understanding, research, drafting, refinement, and formatting—to produce high-quality, structured, and context-aware reports.

Powered by LangGraph’s workflow orchestration, the agents collaborate autonomously, passing memory and tools between each other to ensure every report is accurate, coherent, and tailored to user requirements. The FastAPI backend exposes a clean and scalable API, making the system easy to integrate into applications, dashboards, or automation pipelines.

This project demonstrates a modern agentic architecture suitable for real-world AI report assistants, enterprise knowledge systems, academic writing tools, and automated documentation pipelines.
